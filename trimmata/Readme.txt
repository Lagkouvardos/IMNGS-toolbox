Add all the fastq files that you want trimmed in the folder "toTrim"
Be sure that the files are not compressed.

Open the script with any notepad.
Add the values for trimming at the begining and end of each sequence.
Run the script.

It will create a new folder called "Trimmed" that would contain all the trimmed fastq files.
